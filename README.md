# My Practice Code for Programming Elixir ≥ 1.6

This is a repository for my practice code and exercises from [Programming Elixir ≥ 1.6](https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/ "Programming Elixir") by Dave Thomas. 

Some filenames will match those from the book while others may not. You will also find some exercises missing or incomplete. Some exercises I used only an iex session.

If you'd like to reach out for any reason, you can find me at [ok3](https://ok3.dev).
